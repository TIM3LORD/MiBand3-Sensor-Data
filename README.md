# MiBand3 Sensor data

## Goal
The Goal of this project is to collect as much of the sensor data as possible for the MiBand3 fitness tracker and export it into a csv to allow for Machine Learning and other applications that can perform things such as advanced activiy detection and Fall detection.

## Features
This is still a work in progress with the following functions working
### Working
* Continious live raw heart rate (unlimited duration)
* Live 3 axis raw gyroscope data (limited to approximately 70 seconds for now)

### In progress
* Working on removing the time limit on the live gyro data

### Next up
* Working on live current steps data
* Creating an option to export collected data into a csv

### Enahancement scope
The raw gyroscope data could be callibrated and normalzed. Currently the raw data from the sensors is being collected.
